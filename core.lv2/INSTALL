This software requires only Python to build.

= LV2Core =

This package contains everything necessary to compile against and/or use LV2
plugins and extensions: a header file, pkg-config file, LV2 bundle (with Turtle
files), and a utility program (lv2config).

The configure option --bundle-only can be used to install only the bundle. This
is useful for installing the bundle to a user-specific location (e.g. ~/.lv2).

Any C header(s) are a part of the bundle. Packages must not separate the
header(s) into a separate package from the bundle, as this would break
lv2config. The utility lv2config builds standard LV2 style include directory
trees, and is necessary for compiling LV2 code. Programs can use pkg-config to
check for package 'lv2core' to ensure all this data (bundle, including any
contained header(s), and lv2config) is available on the system. Programs may
also simply check for the header "lv2/lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core/lv2.h".


= Generic Waf Instructions =

As with most build systems, building and installing a project with waf is done
in three separate stages:

Configure: ./waf configure [OPTIONS]
     e.g.: ./waf configure --prefix=/some/where

  The default prefix is /usr/local


Build: ./waf [OPTIONS]
 e.g.: ./waf


Install: ./waf install [OPTIONS]
   e.g.: ./waf install
   e.g.:  DESTDIR=/home/drobilla/packages ./waf install

  The environment variable DESTDIR can be used to add any prefix to
  the install paths (useful for packaging).

  
Run './waf --help' for detailed option information.
