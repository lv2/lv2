<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>LV2 is an interface for writing audio processors, or <q>plugins</q>, in
C/C++ which can be dynamically loaded into many applications, or <q>hosts</q>.
This <q>core</q> specification is simple and minimal, but is designed so that
<q>extensions</q> can be defined to add more advanced features, making it
possibly to implement nearly any feature imaginable.</p>

<p>LV2 maintains a strong distinction between <q>code</q> and <q>data</q>.
Plugin code is in a shared library, while data is in a companion data file
written in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/turtle/">Turtle</a>.
Code, data, and any other resources (e.g. waveforms) are shipped together in a
<q>bundle</q> directory.  The code contains only the executable portions of the
plugin which inherently <em>must</em> be written in code.  All other data is
provided in the data file(s).  This makes plugin data flexible and extensible,
and allows the host to do everything but run the plugin without loading or
executing any code.  Among other advantages, this makes hosts more robust
(broken plugins can't crash a host during discovery) and allows generic tools
and non-C programs to work with LV2 data.  LV2 itself and extensions are
distributed in a similar way.</p>

<p>An LV2 plugin library is suitable for dynamic loading (e.g. via
<code>dlopen()</code>) and provides one or more plugin descriptors via the
<code>lv2_descriptor()</code> function.  These can be instantiated to create
plugin <q>instances</q>, which can be run directly on data or connected
together to perform advanced signal processing tasks.</p>

<p>Plugins communicate via <q>ports</q>, which can transmit any type of data.
Data is processed by first <q>connecting</q> each port to a buffer, then
repeatedly calling a plugin's <code>run()</code> method to process blocks of
data.</p>

<p>This core specification defines two types of port, equivalent to those in <a
href="http://www.ladspa.org/">LADSPA</a>: <a
href="#ControlPort">ControlPort</a> and <a href="#AudioPort">AudioPort</a>.
Audio ports contain arrays with one <code>float</code> element per sample,
allowing a block of audio to be processed in a single call to
<code>run()</code>.  Control ports contain single <code>float</code> values,
which are fixed and valid for the duration of the call to <code>run()</code>.
Thus the <q>control rate</q> is determined by the block size, which is
controlled by the host (and not necessarily constant).</p>

<h4>Threading Rules</h4>

<p>To faciliate use in multi-threaded programs, LV2 functions are partitioned
into several threading classes:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Discovery Class</th>
    <th>Instantiation Class</th>
    <th>Audio Class</th></tr>
<tr><td>lv2_descriptor()</td>
    <td>LV2_Descriptor::instantiate()</td>
    <td>LV2_Descriptor::run()</td></tr>
<tr><td>LV2_Descriptor::extension_data()</td>
    <td>LV2_Descriptor::cleanup()</td>
    <td>LV2_Descriptor::connect_port()</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>LV2_Descriptor::activate()</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>LV2_Descriptor::deactivate()</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The rules that hosts MUST follow are:</p>
<ul>
<li>When any function is running for a plugin instance,
no other function in the same class may run for that instance.</li>
<li>When a <em>Discovery</em> function is running,
no other functions in the same shared object file may run.</li>
<li>When an <em>Instantiation</em> function is running for a plugin instance,
no other functions for that instance may run.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any simultaneous calls that are not explicitly forbidden by these rules are
allowed. For example, a host may call <code>run()</code> for two different
plugin instances simultaneously.</p>

<p>Plugin functions in any class MUST NOT manipulate any state which might
affect other plugin or host code, e.g. by using non-reentrant global
functions.</p>

<p>Extensions to this specification which add new functions MUST declare in
which of these classes the functions belong, define new classes for them, or
otherwise precisely describe their threading rules.</p>

<p>The minor version of an LV2 Resource. This property is used (along with
lv2:microVersion) by hosts to distinguish different versions of a compatible
resource, e.g. to load only the bundle with the most recent version.</p>

<p>The version of an LV2 resource is composed of two fields: minor version,
and micro version. These have the usual semantics:</p>

<ul>
<li>The minor version MUST be incremented when backwards (but not
forwards) compatible additions are made, e.g. the addition of a port to a
plugin.</li>

<li>The micro version is incremented for changes which do not affect
compatibility at all, e.g. bug fixes or documentation updates.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note there is deliberately no concept of a major version: all versions of an
LV2 resource with a given URI are by definition backwards compatible. More
precisely: replacing a resource with a newer version of that resource MUST NOT
break anything. If a change is made which breaks this rule, the URI
of the resource MUST be changed. In contexts where a full (e.g. <a
href="http://semver.org">SemVer</a> conformant) version number is required, the
major version of all released LV2 resources is 1.</p>

<p>Plugins and extensions MUST adhere to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>All versions of a plugin with a given URI MUST have the <q>same</q> set of
mandatory (i.e. not lv2:connectionOptional) ports with respect to lv2:symbol
and rdf:type. In other words, every port on a specific version of a plugin has
a lv2:symbol and a set of rdf:types; all future versions of that plugin are
guaranteed to have a port with the same lv2:symbol and at least those
rdf:types. New types may be added only if doing so does not break
compatibility, i.e. if old hosts will continue to work correctly with the new
plugin.</li>

<li>New ports MAY be added without changing the plugin URI if and only if they
are lv2:connectionOptional and the minor version is incremented.</li>

<li>The minor version MUST be incremented if the index of any port (identified
by its symbol) is changed.</li>

<li>All versions of an extension MUST be compatible in the sense that an
implementation of the new version can interoperate with an implementation of
any previous version.</li>
</ul>

<p>(Note these rules are not necessarily exhaustive)</p>

<p>Anything that depends on a specific version of a plugin (e.g. a
serialisation that references ports by index) MUST refer to the plugin by both
URI and version. However, implementations should be tolerant and extensions
should be designed such that there is no need to do this (e.g. indices should
only be meaningful for a particular plugin <em>instance</em> at run-time).</p>

<p>When hosts discover several installed versions of a resource, they SHOULD
warn the user and load only the most recent version.</p>

<p>An odd minor <em>or</em> micro version indicates that the resource is a
possibly unstable development version. Hosts and tools SHOULD clearly indicate
this wherever appropriate. Several versions of a resource with an odd version
may exist; i.e. it is acceptable to work on a development version of a resource
(e.g. in source control) without worrying about version numbers as long as
either the minor or micro version is odd.</p>

version in source control, the micro version MUST be incremented (to an odd
number) to distinguish this modified version from the previous release.</p>

Indicates that this port does not have to be connected to valid data by the

<p>Indicates that the port is used to express the processing latency incurred
by the plugin, expressed in samples. The latency may be affected by the current
sample rate, plugin settings, or other factors, and may be changed by the
plugin at any time. Where the latency is frequency dependent the plugin may
choose any appropriate value. If a plugin introduces latency it MUST provide
EXACTLY ONE port with this property set which informs the host of the
<q>correct</q> latency. In <q>fuzzy</q> cases the value output should be the
most reasonable based on user expectation of input/output alignment
(eg. musical delay/echo plugins should not report their delay as latency, as it
is an intentional effect).</p>

lv2:minimum 0.0 and lv2:maximum 0.5.
Hosts that support bounds at all MUST support this property.

Indicates that a port's reasonable values are integers (eg. a user interface

A plugin MUST operate reasonably even if such a port has a non-integer input.

Indicates that a port's only reasonable values are the scale points defined for
that port. A host SHOULD NOT allow a user to set the value of such a port to
anything other than a scale point. However, a plugin MUST operate reasonably
even if such a port has an input that is not a scale point, preferably by
simply choosing the largest enumeration value less than or equal to the actual
input value (i.e. round the input value down).
