This specification defines various properties to represent useful information
about LV2 hosts.  Currently, the primary use of this specification is to describe which
extensions are supported by a given host.

The extensions supported by a host can be described like this:
<pre>
@prefix hi: &lt;http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/host-info#&gt; .

&lt;http://example.org/some-host&gt; a hi:Host ;
	doap:name "Foo Rack" ;
	hi:supportsExtension [
		hi:extension &lt;http://example.org/some-extension&gt; ;
		hi:sinceVersion "1.2.0"
