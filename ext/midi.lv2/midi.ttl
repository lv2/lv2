A single raw (sequence of bytes) MIDI event.

These events are equivalent to standard MIDI events, with the following
restrictions to ease the burden on plugin authors:
<ul>
  <li>Running status is not allowed. Every event must have its own status
    byte.</li>
  
  <li>Note On events with velocity 0 are not allowed. These events are
  equivalent to Note Off in standard MIDI streams, but in order to make
  plugins and hosts easier to write, as well as more efficient, only proper
  Note Off events are allowed as Note Off.</li>
  
  <li>"Realtime events" (status bytes 0xF8 to 0xFF) are allowed, but may
  not occur inside other events like they are allowed to in hardware MIDI
  streams.</li>
  
  <li>All events must be fully contained in a single data buffer, i.e. events
  may not "wrap around" by storing the first few bytes in one buffer and
  then wait for the next run() call to store the rest of the event. If
  there isn't enough space in the current data buffer to store an event,
  the event will either have to wait until next run() call, be ignored,
  or compensated for in some more clever way.</li>
  
  <li>All events must be valid MIDI events. This means for example that
  only the first byte in each event (the status byte) may have the eighth
  bit set, that Note On and Note Off events are always 3 bytes long etc.
  The MIDI writer (host or plugin) is responsible for writing valid MIDI
  events to the buffer, and the MIDI reader (plugin or host) can assume that
  all events are valid.</li>
</ul>
