A Preset for an LV2 Plugin.  A preset can be considered an "overlay" on a
Plugin.  Rather than attempting to define all valid predicates for a Preset
(which is not possible since presets may need to specify values for things
defined in other extensions), the presets extension simply provides this
class which can be augmented with any data in the exact same fashion as the
definition of a Plugin.

A Preset SHOULD have at least one pset:appliesTo property.
Each Port on a Preset MUST have at least a lv2:symbol property and a
pset:value property.

Specifies the Plugin(s) a Preset may be applied to.  When a Preset applies
to a Plugin, that Preset SHOULD have ports for every control port on that
plugin, each of which SHOULD have a pset:value property.  If the Preset is
missing ports, or refers to ports which do not exist on the Plugin, then
the host SHOULD apply all the values in the preset that do match the Plugin.

The Preset MAY have any other values that should be applied to the Plugin
in some way.  The host SHOULD simply ignore any values on a Preset it does
not understand.
