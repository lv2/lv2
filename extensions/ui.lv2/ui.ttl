This extension defines an interface that can be used in LV2 plugins and hosts
to create UIs for plugins. The UIs are similar to plugins and reside in shared object
files in an LV2 bundle.  UIs are associated with a plugin in RDF using the triples
<pre>
@prefix ui: &lt;http://lv2plug.in/ns/extensions/ui#&gt; .

&lt;http://my.plugin&gt;   ui:ui     &lt;http://my.pluginui&gt; .
&lt;http://my.pluginui&gt; a         ui:GtkUI ;
                     ui:binary &lt;myui.so&gt; .
</pre>
where &lt;http://my.plugin&gt; is the URI of the plugin,
&lt;http://my.pluginui&gt; is the URI of the plugin UI and &lt;myui.so&gt;
is the relative URI to the shared object file.

While it is possible to have the plugin UI and the plugin in the same shared
object file it is probably a good idea to keep them separate so that hosts
that don't want UIs don't have to load the UI code.  A UI MUST specify its
class in the RDF data (ui:GtkUI in the above example). The class defines what
type the UI is, e.g. what graphics toolkit it uses.  Any type of UI class can
be defined separately from this extension.

(Note: the prefix above is used throughout this file for the same URI)

It is possible to have multiple UIs for the same plugin, or to have the UI
for a plugin in a different bundle from the actual plugin - this way people
other than the plugin author can write plugin UIs independently without
editing the original plugin bundle.

Note that the process that loads the shared object file containing the UI
code and the process that loads the shared object file containing the actual
plugin implementation are not necessarily the same process (and not even
necessarily on the same machine).  This means that plugin and UI code can
<b>not</b> use singletons and global variables and expect them to refer to
the same objects in the UI and the actual plugin. The function callback
interface defined in this header is the only method of communication between
UIs and plugin instances (extensions may define more, though this is
discouraged unless absolutely necessary since the significant benefits of
network transparency and serialisability are lost).

Since the LV2 specification itself allows for extensions that may add new
functionality that could be useful to control with a UI, this extension
allows for meta-extensions that can extend the interface between the UI and
the host. These extensions mirror the extensions used for plugins - there are
required and optional "features" that you declare in the RDF data for the UI as
<pre>
&lt;http://my.pluginui&gt; lv2:requiredFeature &lt;http://my.feature&gt; .
&lt;http://my.pluginui&gt; lv2:optionalFeature &lt;http://my.feature&gt; .
</pre>
The rules for a UI with a required or optional feature are identical to those
of lv2:Plugin instances: if a UI declares a feature as required, the host is
NOT allowed to load it unless it supports that feature; and if it does support
a feature, it MUST pass an appropriate LV2_Feature struct to the UI's
instantiate() method.  These features may be used to specify how to pass
specific types of data between the UI and the plugin port buffers
(see LV2UI_Write_Function for details).

UIs written to this specification do not need to be threadsafe - the
functions defined below may only be called in the same thread the UI
main loop is running in.

Note that this UI extension is NOT a lv2:Feature. There is no way for a
plugin to know whether the host that loads it supports UIs or not, and
the plugin must always work without the UI (although it may be rather
useless unless it has been configured using the UI in a previous session).
From the plugin perspective, control from a UI is the same as control
from anywhere else (e.g. the host, the user): via ports.

A UI does not have to be a graphical widget, it could just as well be a
server listening for OSC input or an interface to some sort of hardware
device, depending on the RDF class of the UI.

ui:makeSONameResident a lv2:Feature ;
    rdfs:comment """
This feature is ELF specific - it should only be used by UIs that
use the ELF file format for the UI shared object files (e.g. on Linux).
If it is required by an UI the UI should also list a number of SO names
(shared object names) for libraries that the UI shared object
depends on and that may not be unloaded during the lifetime of the host
process, using the predicate @c ui:residentSONames, like this:
<pre>
&lt;http://my.pluginui&gt; ui:residentSONames "libgtkmm-2.4.so.1", "libfoo.so.0"
</pre>
The host MUST then make sure that the shared libraries with the given ELF
SO names are not unloaded when the plugin UI is, but stay loaded during
the entire lifetime of the host process. On Linux this can be accomplished
by calling dlopen() on the shared library file with that SO name and never
calling a matching dlclose(). However, if a plugin UI requires the
@c ui:makeSONameResident feature, it MUST ALWAYS be safe for the host to
just never unload the shared object containing the UI implementation, i.e.
act as if the UI required the @c ui:makeResident feature instead. Thus
the host only needs to find the shared library files corresponding to the
given SO names if it wants to save RAM by unloading the UI shared object
file when it is no longer needed. The data pointer for the LV2_Feature for
this feature should always be set to NULL.
